title: About
---
I am currently a post-doc at the Quantum Technology Institute in KRISS(Korea Research Institute of Standard and Science) under the supervision of [Jinwoong Cha](https://sites.google.com/view/jcha).
Here, I fabricate and characterize quantum hybrid systems.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in [CULTure lab](https://absoluteze.ro/) under the supervision of Hyoungsoon Choi.
During the course, I developed and characterized the MEMS gyroscopes as angular momentum sensors and investigated the sensitivity limit of the sensors.

I am interested in the quantum behavior and ultimate sensitivity of the macroscopic mechanical resonators.

You can see my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) here.
