I am currently a post-doc in the [Hybrid Quantum Systems Research Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/jcha).
Here, I fabricate and characterize quantum hybrid systems.

Previously, I earned my PhD in [CULTure lab](https://absoluteze.ro/) under the supervison of Hyoungsoon Choi.
During the course, I developed, characterized the MEMS gyroscopes as angular momentum sensors and investigated the sensitivity limit of the sensors.

I am interested on the quantum behavior and ultimate sensitivity of the macroscopic mechanical resonators.

You can see my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) here.
